# Archive

This directory contains archived code and scripts that have fulfilled their purpose
but are preserved for historical reference.

## Structure

- `code/pruebas/fix_scripts/` - One-time fix scripts for PAES question processing

## Policy

- Archived code is excluded from linting (see `pyproject.toml`)
- Do not add new functionality here; this is for preservation only
- If you need to reference archived code, copy and adapt it rather than importing
