### Cognitive Progression Notes

- Two parallel foundational concepts: slope (001) and y-intercept (003) can be learned independently.
- Convergence point: M1-LF-004 combines both concepts into the standard form y = mx + b.
- Three application paths:
  - Calculation path: 001 → 002 → 006 (slope calculation to equation from points)
  - Equation construction path: 004 → 005 (writing equations from given components)
  - Visualization path: 004 → 007 (graphing)
  - Interpretation path: 001 + 003 → 008 (real-world meaning)
- Most advanced: M1-LF-006 requires both calculation skills (002) and equation understanding (004).

The graph is acyclic and follows a clear cognitive progression from conceptual understanding to application.
