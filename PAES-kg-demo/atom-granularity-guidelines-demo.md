# Atom Granularity Guidelines

An atom is the smallest cognitively meaningful unit of knowledge that can be taught, practiced, and assessed independently.

To determine if a learning element is a valid atom, check the following criteria:

1. **Retrieval Coherence**  
   The concept should be recalled as one unit. If students typically retrieve parts separately, it should be split.

2. **Working Memory Load**  
   An atom should not overload working memory. If it requires more than ~4 novel elements, split it.

3. **Prerequisite Independence**  
   If part A must be learned before part B, then A and B cannot belong to the same atom.

4. **Assessment Independence**  
   If a teacher can assess two parts separately, they should be separate atoms.

5. **Generalization Boundary**  
   If two skills generalize differently across contexts, they should not be in the same atom.

Atoms must:
- have exactly one cognitive intention,  
- be teachable in an isolated mini-lesson,  
- support one or more standards.
